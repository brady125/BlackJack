Hello,
My Name is Brady Morin and I am a Second Year Software Engineer. 
I am attempting to re-create the card game poker with a full stack project in react
I've never played poker but I thought this would be a great way to get started!
I will also give the user details of the percentages of winning and losing hands and with and without counting cards
It is December 2022 hopefully I can finish this!

Thank you
